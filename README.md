<summary>We moved to GitLab!</summary>

Recently we moved our repositories to GitLab. You can find the Revolution Pi
GitLab Organization here: https://gitlab.com/revolutionpi  
All repositories will be updated on GitHub whenever a change happens on GitLab.

We still maintain a presence on GitHub but our work happens over at GitLab. If
you want to contribute to any of our projects we would prefer this on GitLab,
but we also still accept contributions on GitHub.
